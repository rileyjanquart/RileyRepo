## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Go ahead and type some text below!

The above text is included anytime you create a new RMarkdown file. Try making bold or italic text, bulleted lists, or just playing around with the differences between the 'Source' and 'Visual' editing modes. Knit the document after you're finished editing to view the output document. Save your document with a new file name. If you're satisfied with your edits, go ahead and stage, commit, and push! You don't need to push your html file created by knitting your document, but you can if you want.
